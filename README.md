## 1. About
Nourish Hope is a small, public-facing site intended to:
- Educate visitors about student food insecurity
- Share actionable community projects and volunteer opportunities
- Showcase student-led initiatives and resources
- Serve as a portfolio piece demonstrating project design, structure, and impact

This repo contains the source files for the website (HTML, CSS, JS, assets).

---

## 2. Features
- Static, responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Project pages / case studies
- Resource download (PDFs / certificates)
- Contact / donate / volunteer call-to-action
- Simple, accessible components (forms, cards, nav)
- Lightweight: optimized images and lazy loading

---

## 3. Tech stack
- HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid), vanilla JavaScript
- Optional: small build (npm + PostCSS or plain SCSS) â€” depends on how you prefer to manage styles
- Hosting: Neocities (primary) â€” can also use GitHub Pages for pipeline testing or mirror
- Tools: Lighthouse for performance checks, W3C validator for markup

## 5. Run locally
This is a static site â€” easiest ways to preview:

**Option A â€” Quick (Python HTTP server)**
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nourishhope.git
cd nourishhope
# python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

**Option B â€” live reload (if you want auto-reload)**
```bash
# using npm + live-server
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```

**Option C â€” with a small build step (if using SCSS)**
```bash
# if using npm for builds
npm install
npm run build  # run your build script
npm run serve  # dev server
```

---

## 6. Deploying

**Neocities (current live site):**
- Manual: upload the built files from your local directory to your Neocities site dashboard.
- CLI: use `neocities` CLI if you prefer automation (install node/neocities package and authenticate).

**GitHub Pages (optional mirror):**
- Option 1: Put the site in `docs/` and enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (main branch / docs folder).
- Option 2: Use a GitHub Action to build (if applicable) and push to `gh-pages` branch.

**Continuous deployment tips**
- Keep `src/` and `dist/` clear. Build into `dist/`, then deploy `dist/` to Neocities or `docs/` for Pages.
- Add a GitHub Action to lint HTML/CSS and run Lighthouse CI on PRs for performance regression checks.

## 7. Contributing
Thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

**Guidelines**
1. Fork the repo and create a new branch: `feature/<short-description>`
2. Make changes, run local checks (HTML validator, Lighthouse), and commit with clear messages.
3. Open a Pull Request describing what changed and why. Link relevant issue if present.

**Issue template (suggestion)**:
- Title: short and descriptive
- Description: problem, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual, screenshots if applicable
- Priority & type (bug/feature/content)

**Code style**
- HTML: semantic structure, use proper headings (`h1` once per page), `alt` text for images
- CSS: modular, prefixed class names (BEM-like) if the project scales
- JS: keep minimal; accessibility-first interactions

---

## 8. Accessibility & SEO notes (forward-thinking)
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
- Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
- Keyboard accessible navigation and focus states.
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum).
- Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links that open in a new tab.
- Add meaningful meta tags: title, description, `og:` tags, `twitter:` tags.
- Provide language attribute on `<html lang="en">`.
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) for project/case-study pages to improve discoverability.

---

## 9. Tests & validation
- Run Lighthouse (Performance / Accessibility / Best Practices / SEO) â€” aim for score improvement iterations.
- W3C HTML validator for markup issues.
- CSS validator and accessibility linters (axe, pa11y) for automated checks in CI.

---

## 10. Assets & credits
- Keep an `assets/credits.md` listing image sources, icon attributions, fonts, and third-party assets.
- If you include images not created by the project, store license details and attribution in that file.

---

## 11. License
This project is open source. Suggested: **MIT License**
(Include `LICENSE` file at repo root with MIT text.)

- Key challenges & how you solved them
- Metrics (visitors, engagement, downloads, social shares)
- Before/after screenshots, code snippets, and lessons learned

If you'd like, I can also:
- generate `case_study.md` and save it alongside this file,
- create a simple GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages,
- or produce a small script to push files to Neocities.

Which of those should I create next?
