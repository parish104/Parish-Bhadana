eference 1: Health Monitoring Devices & Apps
Science

    Accurate Biomedical Data: These devices measure precise health metrics such as heart rate (beats per minute), blood glucose levels (mmol/L), and body composition (percentages of fat, water, and muscle).
    Scientific Standards: Data is presented using internationally recognized units, ensuring it’s verifiable and scientifically meaningful.
    Data Visualization: Complex numerical data is simplified through graphical elements like bars, meters, and color coding for easy user interpretation.

Language and Literature

    Motivational Language: Phrases like “Great job!” or “You need a boost!” are used to reduce user anxiety and encourage continued engagement with the device.
    Multimodal Communication: Combines textual feedback, visuals, and interactive features to make scientific data more accessible to users.
    Behavioral Science Integration: Employs positive reinforcement, drawing from psychological theories to motivate users and support habit formation.

Integration, Benefits, and Limitations

    Integration: Science provides the raw health data, while language translates it into encouraging, user-friendly messages and visuals.
    Benefits:
        Science: Simplifies complex data, enabling informed health decisions for all users.
        Language and Literature: Boosts engagement and trust through a positive tone and clear communication.
    Limitations:
        Science: Oversimplification may lead to misinterpretation; proprietary algorithms lack transparency.
        Language and Literature: Overly positive language might create a false sense of security; lacks detailed scientific explanations.

Reference 2: Where Does My Data Go? (Video Script)
Science

    Digital Systems: Explains the technical processes of how apps collect, store, and utilize personal data.
    Data Ethics: Addresses the scientific and ethical implications, such as data persistence and corporate control over user information.

Language and Literature

    Expository Script: Uses rhetorical questions and repetition to build tension and engage viewers emotionally.
    Tone and Structure: Adopts an informative yet cautionary tone, structured to guide viewers toward critical reflection on data practices.

Integration, Benefits, and Limitations

    Integration: Science provides the factual basis of data systems, while language crafts a compelling narrative to highlight risks and ethics.
    Benefits:
        Science: Educates users about data collection, enhancing digital literacy.
        Language and Literature: Engages viewers emotionally and encourages critical thinking through rhetorical devices.
    Limitations:
        Science: Lacks in-depth technical details about data systems; risks are generalized.
        Language and Literature: Cautionary tone may overemphasize negatives; assumes viewers have some prior knowledge of terms.

Reference 3: Four Perspectives on Data Collection
Science

    Real-Life Applications: Demonstrates how wearable tech is used for health management, such as in diabetes care or fitness tracking.
    User Experience: Examines differences in trust and usage across age groups, grounded in practical observations.

Language and Literature

    Narrative and Tone: Features distinct language for each stakeholder (e.g., a patient, a tech developer), reflecting their unique perspectives and biases.
    Point of View: Highlights how media shapes perceptions by emphasizing stakeholder motivations and emotional tones.

Integration, Benefits, and Limitations

    Integration: Science offers real-world examples of data use, while language provides narrative depth to reveal diverse human experiences.
    Benefits:
        Science: Contextualizes data’s practical impact and acknowledges user diversity.
        Language and Literature: Builds empathy and teaches critical analysis of biases through varied voices.
    Limitations:
        Science: Relies on anecdotal evidence rather than broad empirical data; scope is limited to a few perspectives.
        Language and Literature: Narratives may not represent all users; emotional tones could obscure objectivity.

Reference 4: Journalistic Text Types
Science

    Science Communication: Analyzes how scientific concepts, like health or technology data, are presented in various media formats.
    Critical Evaluation: Encourages scrutiny of scientific claims made in journalism, fostering a scientific mindset.

Language and Literature

    Text Type Analysis: Breaks down the purpose, tone, and structure of media forms like ads, opinion pieces, news articles, and explainers.
    Media Literacy: Teaches how language in media influences perceptions of scientific information.

Integration, Benefits, and Limitations

    Integration: Science provides the content (e.g., health tech facts), while language examines how it’s communicated and interpreted in media.
    Benefits:
        Science: Promotes critical thinking about scientific claims; improves clarity in science writing.
        Language and Literature: Enhances media literacy by revealing purpose and bias in texts.
    Limitations:
        Science: Focuses more on communication than scientific depth; examples are generalized.
        Language and Literature: Simplifies text types, potentially missing nuances; assumes basic media knowledge.

Reference 5: Advertising Campaign - "Step by Step"
Science

    Health Metrics: Ties the campaign to measurable data like body composition (weight, fat %, water %) tracked by devices.
    Behavioral Science: Leverages principles of self-monitoring and habit formation to encourage health improvements.

Language and Literature

    Persuasive Techniques: Employs repetition, slogans, and a motivational tone to inspire action.
    Visual and Verbal Messaging: Pairs positive reinforcement with progress visuals to make the campaign memorable and appealing.

Integration, Benefits, and Limitations

    Integration: Science supplies the health data and behavioral insights, while language crafts an emotionally compelling campaign to drive engagement.
    Benefits:
        Science: Raises health awareness and supports behavior change through tracking.
        Language and Literature: Engages users emotionally and promotes consistency with a positive tone.
    Limitations:
        Science: Lacks transparency about data processes; may foster over-reliance on the campaign’s claims.
        Language and Literature: Oversimplifies science for emotional appeal; persuasive tone risks manipulation.
